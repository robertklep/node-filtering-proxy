## Filtering proxy

This Node.js based HTTP/HTTPS proxy allows you to rewrite HTTP requests and responses based on rules (*if request matches this hostname, block the request*, etc). You can also add/remove/modify content on specific pages.

It has limited support for filtering HTTPS requests, in that you can use it
to block request to particular hostnames.

### Installation

First, make sure that recent versions of Node and NPM [are installed](http://nodejs.org/).

Next, install directly from the GitHub repository:

```
[sudo] npm install robertklep/node-filtering-proxy -g
```

`sudo` may or may not be necessary. Try without first, you may already have the right permissions to write to the global installation path.
